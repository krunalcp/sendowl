# Sendowl

Ruby client for Send Owl. Check it out at [SendOwl](https://www.sendowl.com/)

## Getting Started

### Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "sendowl"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sendowl

### Configure your API key and API secret

You can set your API key/secret in Ruby:

```ruby
Sendowl.api_key        = "YOUR_API_KEY"
Sendowl.api_secret     = "YOUR_API_SECRET"
```

or set the environment variable _SENDOWL\_API\_KEY_ (**recommended**)
and _SENDOWL\_API\_SECRET_ (**recommended if needed**)

## Usage

So far, one single feature from the whole platform is available: Licenses.

### Licenses

#### Validating a License Key

To validate a License Key, all you need to do is the following:

```ruby
Sendowl::License.new(product_id: 1, key: "ABCD-1234-EFGH-5678").valid?
```

This returns `true` or `false`

## Contributing

### TODO

As you may have noticed, this gem is in construction and most features are not yet
available. So support to Products, Bundles, Subscriptions, Drip Items etc are
missing and I welcome any effort to help supporting those features.

This gem also needs specs and, since it's been brought to life in a hurry
because I only needed one feature of it, has no open source CI configured nor
anything that remotely guarantees its stability. So help in making it stable is
also welcome.

### Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
